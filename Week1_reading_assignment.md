Understanding Data Bias

This article discusses the inherent bias of machine learning applications and how the data used to train these program influences the outcome. The main points of the article stem from the bias of almost all big data sets, how those data sets can be discriminatory, and in return how to evaluate the biases in the data beforehand. Data is biased when it does not include factors that capture the entirety of a concept or is content generated by a human with preconceived biases. Informative platforms on the internet are crowded by a small number of users that produce the most amount of information which leads to a lack of representation across the board. Regardless these platforms produce a large amount of data used to not only inform the world but also train machine learning programs. A feedback loop is created from an ML model producing information then receiving the data to then train it again. Other factors include changes in the system that the program is not trained to accommodate or omitting significant data and just plain societal bias. In conclusion, the article states the first step to resolving this is understanding bias and that it exists. Suggestions for fixing the bias in the data sets included randomization and programming the ML algorithm to learn while simultaneously checking itself. 

I think it’s informative when looking at data to see it’s all inherently biased and how that may skew the outcome. The bias goes beyond silences in the data and more into how societal influence doesn’t stop at the machine’s door but instead heavily influences it. In my data exploration, I’m attempting to take hard numbers and separate them from the humans that created them but that is nearly impossible. It’s difficult to track the spread or even an abundance of misinformation when there is consistently a human controlling its course. We can see today how the Silicon Six can remove a misinformation influencer instantly, whether it’s for better or worse that is removing an element in the data set that cannot be ignored. Overall, I think this article will encourage me to look more critically at the data I collect, not only looking for biases but also examining the motives and the reasons as to why a phenomenon is the way

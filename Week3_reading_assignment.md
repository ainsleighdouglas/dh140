# [Rachel Levine on using Open Street Maps for humanitarian causes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zastnYViHU&feature=youtu.be)

I think it’s fantastic that people are taking advantage of open data to make large projects like the ones she has talked about work. During this talk, I couldn’t stop thinking about the new exposure notification technology that apple and google created to track covid. After doing a little research the privacy policies are very strict but the whole concept of being able to detect your prolonged exposure to someone through Bluetooth signals seems rather provocative. In this talk, she referenced being able to track the impacts of natural disasters through people’s internet/cell activity. Although neither of these concepts is truly invasive they touch on much larger concerns of the future. Open-source data is extremely important to handling global projects and for the most part, is highly beneficial to programs with low funding but to me, it makes me question the possibilities and consequences of technology even if it is for humanitarian causes.

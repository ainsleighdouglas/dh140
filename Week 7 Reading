# Week 7 - HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities

After reading through the assigned pages and the section on Iran I had a realization of social responsibility on social media. For the most part in the United States, it's shocking if the information on social media is blocked or deleted but there are obviously cases where it's understood that the post will be taken down. I thought deeply into the concept written in this book about “participation without condition” and how everyone should be able to tell his or her story to contribute to the collective record. This has obviously changed over time from word of mouth to permanence on the internet, as well as unstoppable spread. I think it’s understood that everyone thinks differently and has different motivations but it’s easy for echo chambers reinforced by social media to give people a false sense of popular opinion. In the case of Iran, it wasn't the abundance of information, it was the lack thereof that created the echo chamber. In times it may seem critical to silence a voice to help many but thoughts, by relation tweets, are unpredictable at their essence. One voice may be silenced but another will take its place. The only way to approach this is to filter and organize what’s important to you on your own individual basis.
